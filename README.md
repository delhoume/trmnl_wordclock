This is a simple Word Clock in english language that is build with TRMNL UI framework.

It is a standalone webpage entirely rendered on the client. Uses css and javascript

Having no time to convert it to Ruby or TRMNL templates, I donate this code to the TRMNL team, hoping someone
converts the very simple logic to a native TRMNL plugin.
